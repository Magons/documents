# Behavior

* Javascript will auto create variables, but it is good practice to use the var prefix `var MYVAR = VALUE`
* Javascript does not care about white space
* Weak typing language (generic variables)
  * Variables start off undefined and are not beholden to a type
  * The content of the variable is what matters (such as string, boolean, numbers etc.)
  * No guarantee the variable contains the type of data you expect it you
  * Numbers are reprsented as-is, and positive by default, sans quotes.

# Variables

variables are represented literal, i.e. `value`, not `$value` or `"value"`

# Statements

You can combine statements on line with a comma

# Functions

* Functions can be added in any order (the interpreter scans for them first)

# Keywords

**alert: **
```
alert("Hello world");
```

# Simple math
