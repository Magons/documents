# About

Some general notes once RHCSA falls into view

# General test taking tips

## Advice

* You have access to all the documentation on the system, including html docs and man pages
* You can't hesitate with RHCE questions, either you know them or don't waste the time. There is not near enough time to do and check everything properly.
* Even if you know the RHCSA really well, you'll need every minute to do the RHCE. Any hesitation or hang up can cause a failure. Skip the question, move on. Return if possible.
* Instead of trying to memorize configurations, commands, etc - remember where to find references during your exam. Remember to install the apache manuals or "man semanage-fcontext" for command examples.

## Pitfalls

1. **Time**:  
You can't hesitate with RHCE questions, either you know them or don't waste the time. There is not near enough time to do and check everything properly. I wouldn't recommend to use manpages or help commands because every question you try to answer that way, you lose 2 questions you could have respond in the meantime. Like the military, you should know how to mount your rifle with the eyes closed.
2. **Real world experience**:  
RHCE is not about "read this book, memorize every phrase of it and you will pass". RHCE exam gives you real world problems that you may or may not have encountered in your daily basis, so don't expect an academic exam, it is a real problem test. If you don't have at least a couple of years of real and daily linux background in your job you won't likely know how to answer some questions. The exam is already very tough in time and difficulty so skipping those kind of questions thinking "i don't have the experience but i have the theory and it will compensate" will probably drop you as the requeriment score is already high.

## Test taking

Good:
