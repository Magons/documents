## Creeating scripts

* When creating scripts, take special note of the PIG and UDF helper functions at the top of the script creation window.
* Data is loaded via HCatalog, which allows us to share schema across tools and users within our Hadoop environment.

# Note

Most, if not all the core notes are stored in the pig.md document:

> hadoop/hadoop-projects/pig.md

The example script for Pig is referenced within.
