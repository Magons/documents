# About

Notes around pracitce labs and exercises

# Hortonworks

Content of Labs is hosted at https://github.com/hortonworks/tutorials with content delivered and presented via hortonworks.com

# HDP Lab 3

Source: [Hortonworks.com (Hello World)](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/hello-world-an-introduction-to-hadoop-hcatalog-hive-and-pig/)

## Creeating scripts

* When creating scripts, take special note of the PIG and UDF helper functions at the top of the script creation window.
* Data is loaded via HCatalog, which allows us to share schema across tools and users within our Hadoop environment.

# Note

Most, if not all the core notes are stored in the pig.md document:

> hadoop/hadoop-projects/pig.md

The example script for Pig is referenced within.
