# Tez

* Customizable and extensible framework/API for building high performance batch and interactive data processing applications, coordinated by YARN in Apache Hadoop
* Based on expressing a computation as a dataflow graph (DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph)
* Speeds up MapReduce while maintaining MapReduces's scaling paradigm
* Used by Hive and Pig
* Extensible and embeddable, providing the fit-to-purpose freedom to express highly optimized data processing applications and giving them an advantage over end-user-facing engines such as MapReduce and Spark

# Data

* Tez gives a very nice and detailed view of jobs, mapping out meta details and statistics.
* HDP > Tez view can provide a great deal of information in visual layouts
