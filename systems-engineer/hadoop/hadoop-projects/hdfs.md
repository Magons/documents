# About

A single physical machine gets saturated with its storage capacity as data grows. With this growth comes the impending need to partition your data across separate machines. This type of File system that manages storage of data across a network of machines is called a Distributed File System. HDFS is a core component of Apache Hadoop and is designed to store large files with streaming data access patterns, running on clusters of commodity hardware.

# Features

* Distributed file system across multiple servers
* Can scale up to 200 PB / 4500 servers on a single cluster
* NameNaode manages cluster metadata 
* DataNodes store the data

# Namenode

The NameNode does not directly send requests to DataNodes. It sends instructions to the DataNodes by replying to heartbeats sent by those DataNodes. The instructions include commands to:

* replicate blocks to other nodes,
* remove local block replicas,
* re-register and send an immediate block report, or
* shut down the node.

# HDFS shell

* [HDFS filesystem shell commands](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html)

## file and folder management

#### Removing folder

Simple removal:
```
sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -rm -r /path/to/folder
```

Permenant removal (skips trash)
```
# Usage: hdfs dfs -rmr [-skipTrash] URI [URI â€¦]
sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -rmr -skipTrash /path/to/folder
```

## Notable examples

removing folder

```
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -rm -r /user/testuser1
```

if you somehow created a user dir with a new line...

```
# verify
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -find /user -name "*testuser1\n"

# Remove
sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -rm -r /user/"*testuser1\n"
```
