# Mock-specific

* See [documents/centos-fedora-rhel/mock](https://github.com/ProfessorKaos64/documents/blob/master/centos-fedora-rhel/mock.md)

Example mock build with `rpmbuild` (see `/etc/mock`):

```
mock -r centos-7-x86_64 --spec=component.spec --sources=. --resultdir=mock/result --buildsrpm
```

# Misc

# RPM package quick start:

## Generating spec file templates

Generating a clean spec file template:

```
rpmdev-newspec <PKG_NAME>
```

## Sources

It is good practice to download sources properly with `spectool`:
```
spectool -R -g *spec
```

`-g` - gets the sources/patches that are listed with a URL
`-R` - download into rpm's %{_sourcedir}.

## Building

Building locally:

```
fedpkg --dist f24 local
```

Building with mock (fedora):

```
fedpkg --dist f24 mockbuild
```

Building with mock (CentOS or RHEL):

```
mock -r <CONFIG_FILE_IN_ETC_MOCK> rebuild <PKG.src.rpm>
```

## Changelog

Manual:
```
* date Packager's Name <packager's_email> version-revision
- Summary of changes
```

Automatic:
```
rpmdev-bumpspec --comment=summary of changes --userstring=Packager's Name <packager's_email> spec file 
```

## Review

Lint the package:

Fedora
```
fedpkg --dist f24 lint
```

CentOS/RHEL
```
rpmlint -i <PACKAGE>.spec
```

Using fedora-revew:

```
rm -rf *rpm results*
fedpkg --dist f24 <PKG_NAME>
fedora-review -n <PKG_NAME>
```

Unpacking an RPM package:

```
 rpm2cpio <PACKAGE> | cpio -id 
 ```
 
 # GPG signing
 
The following commands will initiate GPG key creation and export it in a format suitable for distributing to client systems. The created key should be stored safely and backed up, and its passphrase should be known only by trusted administrators.

```
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
gpg --gen-key
gpg --list-keys --fingerprint
gpg --export --armor "rpmbuild <rpmbuild@example.com>" > EXAMPLE-RPM-GPG-KEY
```

To import this key to the RPM database to allow RPM origin and integrity verification, the following command must be run as root on all target systems (naturally this should happen automatically during client installations):

```
rpm --import EXAMPLE-RPM-GPG-KEY
```

Once an RPM has been created it must be signed with the GPG key and uploaded to a correct channel:

```
rpm --resign package.rpm
rhnpush --server=http[s]://satellite.server/APP package.rpm --channel=custom-channel-name
```

The following commands will verify an RPM package located in the current directory:

```
rpm â€“qip pakcage.rpm
rpm -K package.rpm
```
