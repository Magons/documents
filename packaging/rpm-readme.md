# About
Info for items specific to The Linux distirbution, Fedora.

# CentOS-specific

* [centpkg (early stages)](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Centpkg)

# Non-RHEL distros and chroots/mock

Mock often doesn't quick work to initalize the base chroot on non-RHEL related distros. In that case, you can make use of the [build-fedora-chroot](https://github.com/ProfessorKaos64/LibreGeek-Packaging/blob/master/setup-files/build-fedora-chroot.sh) script to create the chroot.

# Open Build System

* [Main site](https://build.opensuse.org/)
* [Tutorial](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Tutorial)

# Misc

* [Working with Kodi and RPM fusion](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_on_Fedora_23_using_RPMFusion_packages#Configuring_Fedora_.2F_Installing_Dependencies)

# RPM package quick start:

## Generating spec file templates

Generating a clean spec file template:

```
rpmdev-newspec <PKG_NAME>
```

## Sources

It is good practice to download sources properly with `spectool`:
```
spectool -R -g *spec
```

`-g` - gets the sources/patches that are listed with a URL
`-R` - download into rpm's %{_sourcedir}.

## Building

### Building locally:

rpmbuild
```
rpmbuild --rebuild /tmp/SRPM_NAME
```

Fedora
```
fedpkg --dist f24 local
```

## Building with mock

* See [documents/mock/readme.md](https://github.com/ProfessorKaos64/documents/blob/master/mock/readme.md)

## Changelog

Manual:
```
* date Packager's Name <packager's_email> version-release_ver
- Summary of changes
```

Automatic:
```
rpmdev-bumpspec --comment=summary of changes --userstring=Packager's Name <packager's_email> spec file 
```

## Review

Lint the package:

Fedora
```
fedpkg --dist f24 lint
```

CentOS/RHEL
```
rpmlint -i <PACKAGE>.spec
```

Using fedora-revew:

```
rm -rf *rpm results*
fedpkg --dist f24 <PKG_NAME>
fedora-review -n <PKG_NAME>
```

Unpacking an RPM package:

```
 rpm2cpio <PACKAGE> | cpio -id 
 ```

# How to create an RPM repository

This is for Redhat 64 bit versions of Linux. You can create your own RPM repository # to host your custom RPM packages.
See "How to create an RPM from source with spec file" for more information.
https://gist.github.com/1376973

## Step: 1 Install createrepo
```
yum install -y createrepo
```

## Step: 2 Create repo directories for hosting your rpms.

Create your repository inside your base directory. You will also need some rpms for
your repo. For this example, I am using RHEL6 and /var/www/repo as base directory.

```
mkdir -p /var/www/repo/rhel/6/{SRPMS,x86_64}
```

## Step: 3 Create `create-repo-metadata` executable file

Use the `create-repo-metadata` command, which can create by downloading a shell
script and making it an executable file. Make sure this file is in a directory in
your $PATH. Run the command `echo $PATH` to list them. Install in /usr/local/bin

IMPORTANT: In the script above, replace the path in 'DESTDIR' with:
/var/www/repo/rhel/6
```
curl http://bit.ly/sZpx8f > /usr/local/bin/create-repo-metadata
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/create-repo-metadata
```

## Step: 4 Create the repository metadata

After creating the metadata, your repository will be ready for use
```
create-repo-metadata
```

Tip!

If you have made this repo publicly available, others can use this yum repo config
file to update their own systems.

Run `vi /etc/yum.repos.d/my.repo` to create the file

```
[myrepo]
name=My Repository
baseurl=http://mywebsite.com/rhel/6/$basesearch
enabled=1
```

Then simply run `yum update` to install the rpms.

# GPG signing
 
The following commands will initiate GPG key creation and export it in a format suitable for distributing to client systems. The created key should be stored safely and backed up, and its passphrase should be known only by trusted administrators.

```
mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
gpg --gen-key
gpg --list-keys --fingerprint
gpg --export --armor "rpmbuild <rpmbuild@example.com>" > EXAMPLE-RPM-GPG-KEY
```

To import this key to the RPM database to allow RPM origin and integrity verification, the following command must be run as root on all target systems (naturally this should happen automatically during client installations):

```
rpm --import EXAMPLE-RPM-GPG-KEY
```

Once an RPM has been created it must be signed with the GPG key and uploaded to a correct channel:

```
rpm --resign package.rpm
rhnpush --server=http[s]://satellite.server/APP package.rpm --channel=custom-channel-name
```

The following commands will verify an RPM package located in the current directory:

```
rpm â€“qip pakcage.rpm
rpm -K package.rpm
```
