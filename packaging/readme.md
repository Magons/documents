# About
This directory contains some useful information for Linux distribution packaging (general info).

# Debugging

* If you experience a "undefined ... function" when compiling a project, chances are that software is either:
  * not installed
  * the wrong package
  * too old
* Case in point, `qtwebengine` with `--system-vpx` (requires >= v 1.5).
