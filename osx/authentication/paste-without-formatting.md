# How to Always Copy & Paste Text Without Formatting in Mac

Advertisement

If you take an everyday chore and shave a few seconds off, you'll earn a lifetime of extra productivity. This rule also holds true for something we do every day on the computer: **copying and pasting text snippets from one apps to another.**

If you are anything like me, I am sure you also hate copy-pasting text "with formatting." You would always prefer to remove any traces of the original format and _follow _the format of the target document.

So, let's see how we can remove some of our frustration by eliminating the original format when we copy-paste in macOS Sierra. The answer is a [keyboard shortcut in macOS Sierra][1] [The Microsoft Office for Mac Keyboard Shortcuts Cheat Sheet][1] [The Microsoft Office for Mac Keyboard Shortcuts Cheat Sheet][1] Our list of common keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft Office for Mac will help you get your work done faster.

## How to Paste Everything as Plain Text

Try to copy something from a web page into your email, and you'll find that the result is distorted by HTML and other unnecessary bits. Here's how you can prevent that using a simple workaround that does not rely on the use of a third-party app.

1. Open **System Preferences** from the Apple menu and select **Keyboard**.
2. On the Keyboard panel, select the tab for **Shortcuts**.
3. Scroll down the list on the left and select **App Shortcuts**.
4. Click the "+" below the boxes to add a shortcut.
5. Select **All Applications** for Application input box. This (theoretically) will apply the shortcut across the board.
6. Type **Paste and Match Style **into the **Menu Title** input box. This takes the copied text and pastes it in using the current document's formatting.

1. In the Keyboard Shortcut input box, type **Command + V**. This adds the Command sign followed by a "V" in this box.
2. Click **Add**.

Here, what we are actually doing is re-mapping the more complicated **Option + Shift + Command + V** keyboard shortcut for "Paste and Match Style" to the simpler **Command + V** keyboard shortcut. This easy tweak will save you some finger gymnastics.

## It Works Everywhere Except…

This keyword hack doesn't work in Microsoft Word. Instead, you can use the Command + Control + V shortcut to display the Paste Special dialog box and then choose **Unformatted Text** from there. For most other needs, the tweak will work (and reduce your frustration).

# How this works

Under Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, what you enter here is an "override" in a way. Normally in an OS X menu, you'll see "Paste","Copy", or "Paste and Match Style". Matching this entry allows you to specify a shortcut for it.
