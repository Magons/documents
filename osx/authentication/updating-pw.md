# Regarding secure-boot password

This mainly is an issue when your user password is out of sync with the secure FileVault due to chaning a password wrong
or doing so without a network connection to your corporate org.

Active Directory password changes maybe not syncing to FileVault on High Sierra

```
sudo sysadminctl interactive -secureTokenStatus username
sudo sysadminctl interactive -secureTokenOn username -password â€“
sudo diskutil apfs updatePreboot /
```
