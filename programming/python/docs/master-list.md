# About

A "master list" / "Enclycopedia" listing of key documents, primarily from docs.python.org

# docs.python.org

You can find the main portal page to the documentation at: https://docs.python.org/. Use the drop down to select the python version you want to review. The URL follows suite (as seen in links below), such as "https://docs.python.org/3.4/" for Python 3.4. To jump to a different version, just change the version in the URL. 

The default will be Python 2.
