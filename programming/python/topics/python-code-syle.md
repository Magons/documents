# About

Describes some policies for code style

# Variable and function naming

See [Pthon PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Functions

Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style

## Variables

Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
