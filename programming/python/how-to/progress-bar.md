# Simple count of items

This is useful for for loops in which you don't know where the "end" is. Say you are scanning the root directory for UID and GID, you at least
want to see how many items or what is going on, right?

```
# above the for loop:
i = 0

# Inside the for loop
i += 1                                                                                                                        â”‚
print('\rItems: {}'.format(i)), 
```

* {} is a place holder for the variable to get inserted
* [format string](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings)

or ...

```
'\rItems: {: 3}'.format(i)``

* The ' 3' pads with spaces to a width of 3 characters.
* Then the 1's place stays in the same spot
