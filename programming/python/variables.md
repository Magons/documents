# About

Notes on working with variables

# Special values

## None

Given this example:
```
start = None
```

* 'None' is a special way of representing nothing, akin to 'NULL'
* The purpose here is to initialize 'start'
* It acts as a placeholder for a value later
* It will also evauluate to False, handy for loops

# Variable contraints

* Can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores
* Cannot start with a number

# Assignment operators

>a += b  
a -= b  
a *= b  
a /= b  
a //= b  
a %= b  
a **= b  
a &= b  
a |= b  
a ^= b  
a <<= b  
a >>= b  

# Assignment statements

## Strings
```
>>> name = "mike"
>>> print name
mike
```
