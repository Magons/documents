# Strings

## print()

* Seperate values with commas
* Concatenate strings with the '+' operator
* The line continuation character is '* x nn', where nn is a numerical value

**Specify a final string to print***

```
# Using a space at the tail end
>>> print("Here", end=" ")
>>> print("it is is...")

# Cutting of at the end of the string
>>> a = "hi"
>>> print a,
```

**Escape sequences**

```
# TAB - t
>>> print("\tThis is tabbed")

# Escaping the special sequence
>>> print("\\this is a sentice, beginning with a slash instead")

# Newline - n
p>>> rint("First line\nSecond line")

# Single quote - \'
>>> print ("\'This is in single quotes\'")

# Ring the system bell :)
>>> print("\a")

```
