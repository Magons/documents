# Coding style

## Indents

This varies, but it's a good idea to use TABs for most languages, with a tabstop of 4. This way, if you require 8 for uniformity, you just tap TAB twice, versus having to use spaces (as backing up will clear the TAB).

## Blanks lines

Whitespace is crucial to clean readable code. A blank line (or two) help visually separate out logical blocks of code.

For example, from [Steve McConnell's Code Complete, Second Edition](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0735619670) chapter on Layout and Style:

>Subjects scored 20 to 30 percent higher on a test of comprehension when programs had a two-to-four-spaces indentation scheme than they did when programs had no indentation at all. The same study found that it was important to neither under-emphasize nor over emphasize a program’s logical structure. The lowest comprehension scores were achieved on programs that were not indented at all. The second lowest were achieved on programs that used six-space indentation. The study concluded that two-to-four-space indentation was optimal. Interestingly, many subjects in the experiment felt that the six-space indentation was easier to use than the smaller indentations, even though their scores were lower. That’s probably because six space indentation looks pleasing. But regardless of how pretty it looks, six-space indentation turns out to be less readable. This is an example of a collision be tween aesthetic appeal and readability.
