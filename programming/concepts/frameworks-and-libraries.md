# What should I choose?

The point of frameworks is to do the work for you; when you just use libraries instead of frameworks you have to cook more of the code yourself from scratch. This results in more code, not less, and more pitfalls to drop into. This approach is usually used when doing something new or when there's a belief a custom bake can create something better than the framework for the use case.
