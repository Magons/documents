# Arithmetic Operators

>a + b Addition Sum of a and b  
a - b Subtraction Difference of a and b  
a * b Multiplication Product of a and b  
a / b True division Quotient of a and b  
a // b Floor division Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts  
a % b Modulus Remainder after division of a by b  
a ** b Exponentiation a raised to the power of b  
-a Negation The negative of a  
+a Unary plus a unchanged (rarely used)  

# Logical operators

>a & b Bitwise AND Bits defined in both a and b  
a | b Bitwise OR Bits defined in a or b or both  
a ^ b Bitwise XOR Bits defined in a or b but not both  
a << b Bit shift left Shift bits of a left by b units  
a >> b Bit shift right Shift bits of a right by b units  
~a Bitwise NOT Bitwise negation of a
